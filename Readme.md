This was a practice project in my journey
this is very series on backend

Professional journey

Production grade applilcation
Software development kesa hota hai

Fresh git repository
Aik project hai, very complex project


pehlay project ka design finnalize kartay hai, that we know
that what to make

UI developer => UI through code
Frontend Engineers => connect frontend with backend like the buttons etc

Every thing is storing like the comments, likes etc

Repository => how to initialize?
1. git init
2. git add . => total files ko
3. git commit -m "add initial files for backend"
4. git branch -M main  => it will change the branch from master to main

5.git remote add origin https://github.com/Sas3380/yourube-clone.git => it will make it remote

6.git push -u origin main  => upstream set karna

git keep => khali file to keep empty folder in git repository

.node gitignore file from gitignore generator

environment variables system say otaye jatay hai e files say nahi letay hai

.env agar github par puch kartay ho tho warning deta hai


Now how to puch these new files as we added some more files

file uploading => utitlity
mailing => as a utitlity

jo functionality bar bar use hoti hai hum uskoo utility banatay hai

mkdir controllers db models middlewares routes utils
 
 we can make multiple files in our directory but we must use teh cmd in vs code

 its difficult to make .gitkeep inside empty files

prettier => sirf extension nahi but also need settings

dev dependencies=> with -D

npm i -D prettier

.prettierignore => kon kon say files may prettier ko ignore karna hai eg. the env file where the structure is a bit tricky
